## Apple doesn't support the standard Push API

At this moment, Apple hasn't added support for the Push API standard yet. It means
our plugin doesn't support iOS (iPhone/iPad) devices and Safari. When Apple adds support to the 
Push API standard, then we should be able to also send Push Notifications to those devices.
